      <h1>Taylorsville Lake: Pre-Construction to Today</h1>
      <h2>Taylorsville, Spencer County, Kentucky 1979-2023</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left-column">
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          In the 20th century, the US Army Corps of Engineers were authorized to build dams across the state of Kentucky to 
          mitigate flooding effects on communities. Two of these communities, Shepardsville, Ky and Taylorsvile, KY, are located 
          on the Salt River in central Kentucky. Construction of the dam project began in June 1974 and work was completed in 1983. 
        </p>

        <p>
          This project is meant to show the need for damming the Salt River at Taylorsville, 
          highlight parts of the construction process and show how the dam and lake function today. 
          The <a href=“https://www.lrl.usace.army.mil/Portals/64/docs/CWProjects/Planning/Master%20Plans/Taylorsville%20Lake%20Master%20Plan%201978.pdf”> 1978 Master Plan</a> was used during the design and implementation process of the dam and guided operations for almost 40 years. 
          The <a href=“https://www.lrl.usace.army.mil/Portals/64/docs/CWProjects/Planning/Master%20Plans/TAYLORSVILLE_COMBINED%20FILES_Public%20Review_508Compliant_Redacted_25Aug2022.pdf”> 2022 Draft Master Plan</a> provided an update to the 1978 Plan and will guide lake and dam operations for the next 25 years.
        
        </p>

      
        <h3>Need for Intervention </h3>
        <p>
          For decades, communities along the Salt River faced effects of flooding. In April 1948, construction of a levee began in Taylorsville to protect residents from flood waters. 
          This was authorized by Congress under the 1936 Flood Control Act. However, Shepardsville had no protection from flood waters. 
        </p>
        <img src="SaltRiverWatershed.png" alt="Salt River Watershed" width="100%" />
        <p class="caption">The Salt River Watershed is located in Central Kentucky. The Chaplin, Beech Fork, 
          Rolling Fork and Floyd's Fork Rivers all drain into the Salt River before it drains the Ohio River near West Point, Ky. 
          During heavy rain events, the watershed will experience flooding as water runs off the steep knobs that surrond most of the area.
        Prior to the damming of the Salt River, water from the Ohio River would back up into the rivers in the watershed during flood events and cuase additional flooding.  </p>

        <h3>Dam Design Process </h3>
        <p>
          Civil Engineers for this project were tasked with determining the best location for the dam, which included 
          determining the upstream communities that would be impacted. They were also responsible for conducting tests 
          related to the soil composition, like those in the <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA128092.pdf">Foundation Report</a>
          and for determining how much storage the dam would need. Each of these factors impacted the proposed design. 
          Shown below are design documents used in the building of Taylorsville Lake Dam.

The stilling basin (tailwater area) is on the left side of the drawing. The conduit was built to the side of the river bed. which helps to prevent potential failures. Key elevations are marked on the drawing.</p>
